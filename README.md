# push_swap


## Description:

In this project we need to construct a program that sorts a given set of numbers in the least possible ammount of moves possible, we are given a restricted set of operations we're allowed to perform then, we are given the freedom to choose a sorting algorithm.

This project helps us learn and study time complexity, algorithmic complexity and sorting methods, we also have to learn optimization, and personally i got to understand more about bitwise operators, bit manipulation and doubly linked lists.

##  Instructions:

To run this program simply make it using the make command, it will output a push_swap executable file, to run it simply type in the terminal "./push_swap" followed with the numbers you want to sort seperated by spaces for example: 
```./push_swap "12 43 21 74"```

- Gemini was used for this project, it provided 	   automation for repetitive tasks such as formatting the makefile after adding more files and formatting the header file after adding additional files, all based on what i already wrote. 
- Gemini was also used for gathering information and learning about how to apply the radix sorting algorithm into C code.

#### Aditional Info:

- Why Radix? :
	Radix was used due to it's efficiency when it comes to larger numbers, despite being one of the older sorting algorithms till this day it's still quite efficient, though it falls short in smaller numbers.
